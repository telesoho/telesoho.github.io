When I was younger, I considered myself a musician.  As a real musician, I owned a collection of instruments, amplifiers, and cables.  As a real musician, I wrote songs, played with groups, and tossed around words like "gig" *without* irony.  I was so pretentious that I feared not being able to continue writing simply from running out of notes.  "There can only be so many combinations of chords and rhythms, right?"  But I grew older, played less, and listened more.  And I became aware of how little I really knew.  *"Musician?"*  Now just an embarrassing self-title.  

In Wikipedia's overview of the [Dunning-Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunningâ€“Kruger_effect), Bertrand Russel is quoted:

> In the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.

So, it's 2010.  And I am starting a blog.  

Though it may be ten years and [two versions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0) of the Web late, hopefully this delayed entrance will yield an otherwise lacking acute self-awareness of just how unnecessary Yet Another Blog is.  After all, there can only be so many combinations of words, right?

### Who are you?

The [about](/about/) page has that.

### What can I expect?

Mostly technical topics centered on programming concerns as well as design and usability.  I plan to share and discuss code, critique my own and others' work, and make an honest attempt to avoid being just another echo in the techno-blogo-chamber.

### Will it be worth my time?

What a rude, but honest, question.  It may not be at first, but with practice and patience, who knows?

### How often will you post?

I make no promises.

### Well then

Let's get on with it.
