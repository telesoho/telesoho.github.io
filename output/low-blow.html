</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This is a low blow, but it's been awhile since I fired up a fresh Internet Explorer instance within a fresh Windows Virtual Machine.  And, <em>lo...</em></p>
<p><img alt="Internet Explorer 8 in Windows 7" src="/assets/images/lowblow-ie.png" title="Internet Explorer 8 in Windows 7"></p>
<p>Let's compare.</p>
<p><img alt="Safari 5 in OS X" src="/assets/images/lowblow-safari.png" title="Safari 5 in OS X"></p>
<p>I'm not comparing rendering engines &mdash; I deliberately erased the content to cancel that variable.  No, I'm comparing the <em>browsers</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor">Hanlon's Razor</a> can only <em>barely</em> slice into what could otherwise be interpreted as ill will toward users and near-total disregard for painstakingly-crafted Web content.  Yes, this is <em>personal</em>.</p>
<h3>No hierarchy</h3>
<p>What's most important?  The complementary orange-on-blue Bing logo?  The favorites star?  Maybe that <em>other</em> favorites star with the arrow on it?  Or maybe that big red X in the corner?  They certainly all seem more exciting than your web page.</p>
<h3>No grid</h3>
<p>Where are your readers' eyeballs, and why aren't they reading your site?  Maybe they're still bouncing around the pinball machine of overlapping, randomly placed, randomly sized toolbars.</p>
<h3>Microsoft's Brand &gt; Your Brand</h3>
<p><em>While you're using it</em>, Safari does not care if you know its name or icon.</p>
<h3>Your users are tired and scared</h3>
<p>That's right, they've been subconsciously fighting off the ever-encroaching onslaught of ambiguous and repetitious icons and statuses.</p>
<p>"<em>Protected Mode On?</em>  Well that sounds good."</p>
<p>"<em>Internet?</em>  Well, duh"</p>
<p>"<em>100%?</em> A+, I guess."</p>
<p><em>And most personal of all...</em></p>
<h3>So much Color</h3>
<p>Ignoring the heinous gradients, consider the browser's bold and very specific coloring alone and how it thickly surrounds the entire page.  Now try to remember the last time you visited a museum that did <em>not</em> have pure white walls.</p>
<p>Let's hope the Internet Explorer 9 team invests in the browser as much as they have already invested in its rendering engine.</p>
