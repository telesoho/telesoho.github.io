</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>当我还小的时候，我认为自己会是一个音乐家，When I was younger, I considered myself a musician.  As a real musician, I owned a collection of instruments, amplifiers, and cables.  As a real musician, I wrote songs, played with groups, and tossed around words like "gig" <em>without</em> irony.  I was so pretentious that I feared not being able to continue writing simply from running out of notes.  "There can only be so many combinations of chords and rhythms, right?"  But I grew older, played less, and listened more.  And I became aware of how little I really knew.  <em>"Musician?"</em>  Now just an embarrassing self-title.  </p>
<p>In Wikipedia's overview of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, Bertrand Russel is quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it's 2010.  And I am starting a blog.  </p>
<p>Though it may be ten years and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">two versions</a> of the Web late, hopefully this delayed entrance will yield an otherwise lacking acute self-awareness of just how unnecessary Yet Another Blog is.  After all, there can only be so many combinations of words, right?</p>
<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>The <a href="/about/">about</a> page has that.</p>
<h3>What can I expect?</h3>
<p>Mostly technical topics centered on programming concerns as well as design and usability.  I plan to share and discuss code, critique my own and others' work, and make an honest attempt to avoid being just another echo in the techno-blogo-chamber.</p>
<h3>Will it be worth my time?</h3>
<p>What a rude, but honest, question.  It may not be at first, but with practice and patience, who knows?</p>
<h3>How often will you post?</h3>
<p>I make no promises.</p>
<h3>Well then</h3>
<p>Let's get on with it.</p>
